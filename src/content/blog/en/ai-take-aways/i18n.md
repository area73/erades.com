Internationalization (i18n) has traditionally been one of the most tedious and error-prone processes in web development. However, with the arrival of Artificial Intelligence, we are witnessing a paradigm shift that is completely transforming how we approach translations in our projects.

## The shift in approach: from incremental translation to contextual translation

### The traditional method

Traditionally, the workflow for internationalization followed an incremental pattern:

1. **Parallel development**: We built pages while creating translations simultaneously
2. **Context fragmentation**: Each text was translated in isolation, losing visual and functional context
3. **Inconsistencies**: Translations were done in parts, generating inconsistencies in tone and style
4. **Constant revision**: We needed to review and adjust translations as the interface evolved

This approach had a fundamental problem: **context loss**. By translating texts in isolation, we lost the complete vision of how the page worked as a whole.

### The new AI paradigm

With Artificial Intelligence, we can adopt a completely different approach:

1. **Complete monolingual development**: We build the complete page in one language (preferably the team's primary language)
2. **Preserved context**: AI can see the complete page and understand the visual, functional, and user context
3. **Contextual translation**: AI generates translations that maintain coherence with design and functionality
4. **Rapid iteration**: We can adjust and improve translations more efficiently

## Advantages of the new approach

### 1. Complete context until the last moment

The greatest advantage is that we maintain visual and functional context until the moment of translation. Instead of working with keys like `"button.accept"` or `"error.validation"`, AI can see exactly how each text is used in the interface.

### 2. Better translation quality

AI can generate more natural and contextually appropriate translations because it understands:

- The purpose of each element (button, error, label)
- The visual hierarchy of information
- The user interaction flow
- The general tone and style of the application

### 3. Automatic consistency

AI can maintain consistency in:

- Technical terminology
- Communication tone
- Writing style
- Interface conventions

## Challenges and considerations

### Let AI create the hierarchy or do it manually?

This is a crucial point that requires reflection. Traditionally, we extracted patterns to create translation hierarchies:

```typescript
// Traditional approach
const translations = {
  buttons: {
    accept: "Accept",
    cancel: "Cancel",
    save: "Save",
  },
  errors: {
    validation: "Validation error",
    network: "Connection error",
  },
};
```

With AI, we have two options:

#### Option 1: AI generates the structure

Let AI propose the organization of translations based on patterns it detects.

**Advantages:**

- Less manual work
- Automatic pattern detection
- Adaptation to new contexts

**Disadvantages:**

- Less control over structure
- Possible inconsistencies in organization
- Difficult to maintain long-term

#### Option 2: Manual structure with AI guidance

Define patterns and structure, but use AI to generate content.

**Advantages:**

- Total control over organization
- Consistency in structure
- Easier to maintain

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires more initial work
- Less flexibility for changes

## Recommended patterns to guide AI

### 1. Error centralization

Errors should be centralized in a single place to facilitate their management and translation:

```typescript
// Recommended structure
const errorMessages = {
  validation: {
    required: "This field is required",
    email: "Invalid email format",
    minLength: "Minimum {length} characters",
  },
  network: {
    timeout: "Request timeout",
    serverError: "Server error",
  },
};
```

### 2. Reuse of common elements

Elements like buttons, links, and navigation texts should be reusable:

```typescript
const commonElements = {
  buttons: {
    primary: "Continue",
    secondary: "Cancel",
    danger: "Delete",
  },
  navigation: {
    back: "Back",
    next: "Next",
    home: "Home",
  },
};
```

### 3. Interpolation patterns

Define clear patterns for variable interpolation:

```typescript
const patterns = {
  welcome: "Welcome, {name}",
  itemsCount: "{count} items",
  progress: "{current} of {total}",
};
```

## Conclusions

AI is transforming internationalization from a mechanical and error-prone task to a more intelligent and contextual process. The key is finding the balance between automation and manual control.

**The fundamental principles are:**

- Maintain context until the last moment
- Define clear patterns for reuse
- Use AI as a tool, not as a replacement
- Iterate and continuously improve the process

The future of i18n with AI is not about completely replacing manual work, but about making it more efficient, contextual, and of higher quality.
